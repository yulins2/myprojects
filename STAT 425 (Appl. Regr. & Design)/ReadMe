Study on the Impacts of Diets on COVID-19 Fatality Rate 
Group Leader

• Applied machine learning and statistical methodologies, including BIC, linear regression, cross-validation, and PCA, 
  to examine the relationship between the nutritional composition of daily diets and COVID-19 fatality rates of the residents of 170 countries;
• Divided the collected datasets into the training sets and testing sets, established and trained models in R that eventually determine that 
  the Random Forests model was optimal with minimum mean prediction error;
• Took charge of team building, labor division and time management to ensure the successful completion of projects.
